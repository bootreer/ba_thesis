\chapter{Evaluation}
TODO: plots!!!

\section{Setup}
All benchmarks are run on a system with an Intel Xeon E5-2660 with 251GiB of RAM and a 1TB Samsung Evo 970 Pro SSD running Ubuntu 23.10.

\section{Latency}

\section{SPDK Comparison}
Similar speeds to spdk in sequential read and writes (both qd1 and qd32), qd1 random reads within 10\% of SPDK while random writes much slower, however still faster than what the data sheet stats is possible.
