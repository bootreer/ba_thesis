\chapter{Conclusion}\label{c:c}

% Thesis contribution #1 Overview + AKI
This template gives a brief overview of thesis writing. It has a examplary structure to serve as gantry.
Furthermore we show how to plot using matplotlib, seaborn and ggplot.

% Evaluation #2 ACT
ACT was tested for a spatially disjoint workload and outperforms FAST C++ by several orders of a magnitude. 

\paragraph{Future Work}


In conclusion, this thesis uses novel approaches to lay the foundation for spatio-textual data processing on modern hardware. The presented optimizations to the AKI reach the same level as other state-of-the-art indexes. Spatio-textual ACT provides superior performance for disjoint workloads.
