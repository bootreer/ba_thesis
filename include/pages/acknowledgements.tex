I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor \getAdvisor{} and my supervisor \getSupervisor{} for the opportunity to work on this interesting topic.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Max for the thesis template. 

Many people, especially my friends have made valuable suggestions on my thesis. Without your ideas and corrections, the thesis would not be as good as it is now. Thanks to my roommates for proofreading and providing ideas throughout the whole process of writing. Thanks to my apartment for letting me live in it. You get the idea.

This section is completely optional and you may also structure is as you like. Writing it in german is also fine.
